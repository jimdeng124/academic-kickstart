abstract: Person identification normally leverages biometrics which including face or voice recognition, fingerprint identification and so on. In these methods, people must actively participate in the activity for a successful identification. In addition, delicate software and hardware need to be applied for these methods. To overcome these restrictions, a novel person identification method is proposed by using peopleâ€™s footstep-induced vibrations. These time series vibration signals were first converted into two-dimensional time-frequency images by the continuous wavelet transform. Then deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models based on the Deep Residual Shrinkage Network (DRSN) were built to classify these images corresponding to each person respectively. Built on the test results of the CNN model, a new sensor layout strategy is developed which improved the identification success rate to 100%.
